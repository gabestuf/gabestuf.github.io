      <h1>Hello There</h1>
      <p>I am currently a student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute studying Computer Science. I am working on a number
        of other projects
        which you can check out <a class="intext-a" href="projects.html">here</a>. If you are interested in learning
        more about me, I
        have left some snippets below. Thank you! </p>

      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>In my early years, I was very young. Baseball and legos were my two main hobbies. In 6th grade I attended Space
        Camp Robotics, where I put my lego skills to use and built a prize winning robot (our team won first
        place). Writing code for the robot was my first experience programming! It's all been downhill since then.

        <h1>PC Gaming</h1>
        <p> Computers became more significant after I discovered PC gaming. I began learning more about computer
          hardware and how different components worked.</p>

          played in a few bands including Mourning Routine and Emergency Stop.</p>

        <p>One of the aspects of programming I find to be most enjoyable is web development. I feel like there's a lot
          of room for creativity and javascript is pretty easy. One day soon I hope to revamp this website with all the
          new skills I've picked up. </p>

          the summer and have learned and practiced various instrument and recording processes.</p>

        <p>Playing varsity baseball in high school was one of the most demanding and satisfying experiences I've had.
          Competition at that level forced me to approach problems differently. Training and preparing taught me that it
          takes a long time to develop skills. Now I play squash, golf and go bowling regularly, though I could still
          strike you out, given the chance.</p>

        <h1>The LED Board</h1>
        <p> When I first arrived at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in 2019, I knew next to nothing about
          Computer Science. This project's main contributors were Jake, Zach, and Ted, who wired the board, programmed
          the raspberry pi, and designed the entire system. The system featured a web app which could change the text,
          which could scroll across the board or do a number of other animations. Between each LED are diffusers made of
          paper and tape. That's the part I helped with. Though my contribution was small, it was fascinating to be part
          of this team. </p>
