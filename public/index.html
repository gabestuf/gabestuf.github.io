                <p>I am currently a student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute studying Computer Science. I am working

                    <p>One of the aspects of programming I find to be most enjoyable is web development. I feel like
                        there's a lot
                        of room for creativity and javascript is pretty easy. One day soon I hope to revamp this website

                        the
                        new skills I've picked up. </p>

                        the summer and have learned and practiced various instrument and recording processes.</p>

                        hardware and how different components worked.</p>

                    <p>Playing varsity baseball in high school was one of the most demanding and satisfying experiences
                        I've had.
                        Competition at that level forced me to approach problems differently. Training and preparing
                        taught me that
                        it
                        takes a long time to develop skills. Now I play squash, golf and go bowling regularly, though I
                        could still
                        strike you out, given the chance.</p>
