Day 1 - 4/7/2021
actually more like week 2 but I am just now creating the log

CHANGELOG 

V1.0 4/7/2021
- Released first iteration of app
- Able to place settlements on any node 
- Roll or input dice rolls 
- Game will track roll #'s and resources collected per turn

V1.1
- Settlements can be upgraded to cities without having to use settlement button. (For consistency)

V1.2
- Updated UI, still very wack but slightly better

V1.3 
- Added basic robber functionality

V1.4  4/10
- Added buttons to select dice numbers 
- Added resources blocked variable to JSON object for analysis 
- slightly improved UI using grid and JS for robber button highlighting
- logged JSON in local storage
- Added fogged out effect when finish game is clicked to end interaction with the board and some endgame changes to prep for V2 
- Encountered bugs: 
  1. Encountered a strange bug where when rolled a 6, hex 4 was a 6 and contained mud. The desert was on hex 3 with the robber on it.
     I should have gained 1 mud, but instead I gained 1 sheep. I have not been able to recreate a situation like this since. Pls fix :(
  2. If you click settlement button, then robber button, zIndexing creates some weird things. 
     To fix, clicking one will toggle the other off. Will also give me a chance to turn some ugly bits of code into nice functions 
     such as showSettlementLayer, hideSettlementLayer, showBoardLayer,HideBoardLayer

V1.5 4/11
